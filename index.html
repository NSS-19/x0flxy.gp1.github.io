            Nowadays, mobile phones have become essential in our daily lives as there are so many functions which could be done on the phone very easily.
            For exmaple, they have better battery and camera year by year competed against top-notch mobile phone companies.
            You may seem it as very confused and frustrated since there are so many mobile phone companies out there.
            But when we actually search the root of all of the mobile phone category, there are only two: iOS and Android.

            <h3>What is iOS ?</h3>

            iOS is an acronym for <b>iPhone Operating System</b>, and a Unix-derived operating system powering all of Apple's mobile devices.
            The only mobile phone you can use iOS is from Apple, unlike Android operating system, which makes it very distinct from the other companies out there.
            It is really famous for its software updates, UI interface of the applications and the build quality of the phones which makes it luxurious.

            <br>Here I am gonna mention their best and latest <b>iPhone 14 pro</b> which will be the best for you to have in 2022.<br />

        <p>
            Instead of iPhone 14 Pro Max, we chose iPhone 14 Pro due to its size, price and compatibality.
            Later we will compare the main factors of iPhone 14 Pro with other phones so that you can make your choice more easily.

        <h3>What is Android Operationg system?</h3>

        <p>
            An Android phone is a powerful, high-tech smartphone that runs on the Android Operating System (OS) developed by Goolgle.
            It is used by lots of mobile phone manufactures such as <b>Samsung, Google, Oppo, Xiaomi, Huawei, One plus and so on </b> unlike Apple and iOS.
            To make you wonder, Android phones cover almost 70% of all phones bought across the world.
            On the other hand, Apple's iOS powered iPhones account for over 27%.

            Today, we have selected the main rivals of <b>Apple</b> which is <b>Samsung</b>.
            They have introduced us with their impressive technologies and new designs that amazed us in 2022.
            Firstly, our first recommendation is <b>Samsung Galaxy Z fold 4</b>.
            They had done the really great job in manufacturing phones which can be folded like the model we mentioned above.
            Just the design alone is worth of spending your money if you want to stand out among other people.

        <p>
            <a href="https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/galaxy-z-fold4/specs/" target="_blank">Here</a>, you can check the specifications of this phone model.
            You may notice the approach of these two companies which are completely different from each other. 
            While <b>Samsung</b> is developing new technologies, design and shapes, <b>Apple</b> is focusing on user experience and perfection on the software that is already developed.
            Thus, if you are a tech enthusiastic and want to experience new technologies, I would recommend you to choose <b>Samsung</b>.
            Else, going with iPhone never goes wrong for you.
